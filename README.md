# Assignment 5
Continual learning using Avalanche library

In this notebook we will talk about the features offered by the models Avalanche sub-module.

Support for pytorch Modules

Every continual learning experiment needs a model to train incrementally. You can use any torch.nn.Module, even pretrained models. The models sub-module provides for you the most commonly used architectures in the CL literature.

You can use any model provided in the Pytorch official ecosystem models as well as the ones provided by pytorchcv!
