GCN is the most basic of the graph neural networks
﻿Extension of simple feedforward N
﻿For homogeneous graphs (only 1 type of node and 1 type of edge)
﻿Also Graph Attention Network (GAT), Graph Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN),
﻿Algorithms for heterogeneous graphs (RGCN, etc.)
 
We apply three convolutional layers, which means we learn the information about 3 neighbor hops. After that we apply a pooling layer to combine the information of the individual nodes, as we want to perform graph-level prediction.
